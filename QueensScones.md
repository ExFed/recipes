# The Queen’s Scones
While travelling in Wales 30 years ago, one of my processors was served these scones. Unlike most scones, these are not hard or dry but instead melt in your mouth.  The woman told her that they were made by the Queen’s recipe. Apparently her sister works in the Palace! These are so popular with students that she always serves them on the last day of class.

## Ingredients

#### Ingredients:
    2.75 cup unbleached flour
    6 tbsp sugar
    1.5 tbsp baking powder
    1 tsp salt
    0.5 cup butter ( room temperature)
    0.75 cup dried cranberries or golden raisins
    1 cup chilled whipping cream
    2 large eggs
    Low sugar raspberry preserves  ( Smuckers) or homemade preserves.
    Butter and Devonshire clotted cream ( optional)


## Directions
Preheat Oven to 400°

#### Baking
    Mix first 4 ingredients together in a large bowl.
    With hands, mix in butter until mixture resembles coarse corn meal.
    Add fruit and mix until fruit is coated.
    Mix whipping cream and eggs together in a small bowl with whisk just until combined.
    Add cream and egg mixture to flour mixture and stir just until combined.
    Place mixture on floured surface and pat into a mass about 1/2inch thick.
    Cut out scones with  biscuit cutter  of desired diameter. I use one that is about 1 1/2” across. 
    Place on floured insulated baking sheet.
    Bake 10 minutes at 400degrees ; then lower temperature to 350 degrees and bake about 5-8 minutes more until scones are light brown and done. ( Time will vary depending on size of scones and oven. Do not overbake.
    Remove from baking sheet and cool on wire rack.
#### Serving  
    Serve with butter and low-sugar raspberry jam (and Devonshire clotted cream if desired)
